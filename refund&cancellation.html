        <p>   a. In the event of technical difficulties preventing the completion of a learning session, upon verification by SCANPICK PRIVATE LIMITED.</p>
        <p>   b. If the tutor fails to attend a scheduled learning session without prior notice, resulting in inconvenience to the student.</p>
        <p>   c. If the quality of the learning material provided by the tutor significantly deviates from the description or expectations.</p>
        <p>- Refund requests must be submitted within 48 hours of the completion of the learning session.</p>
        <p>- Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days from the date of approval.</p>
